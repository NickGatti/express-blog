# Basic Node+Express server
This is a boilerplate projects, designed to be a starting point for building apps.

# Using in your project
To use this boilerplate, clone the project, delete `.git/`, `package-lock.json`, and modify `package.json` (name, version, description, author) for your project. Then re-init git `git init`. Finally you need to create a `config.js` file in the root, based on `config.example.js`.

From there, you're ready to install dependencies and build your app.

## Running the app
To install dependencies, run `npm install`.

The app can then be run with `npm start`.
